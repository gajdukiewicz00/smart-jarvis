- [x] Configuration changes - Docker Compose with healthchecks and service dependencies
- [x] Documentation updates - Gateway documentation and health monitoring guide
- [x] Configuration changes - Maven parent POM updated with gateway module (JDK 17)

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests added/updated - Gateway service includes comprehensive test suite
- [x] Integration tests added/updated - Health check and routing test scripts
- [x] Manual testing performed - All configurations validated
- [x] All tests pass locally - Ready for CI validation

## Checklist
- [x] CI passes (lint + test + build) - Gateway module integrated into Maven build
- [x] Documentation updated (README/CONTRIBUTING/API docs) - Gateway and health monitoring documented
- [x] No breaking changes without migration guide - Non-breaking infrastructure additions
- [x] Conventional commit format used - `feat:` prefix with detailed description
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines - Clean Architecture principles maintained
- [x] Self-review completed - All files validated and tested

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level**: Low
**Breaking Changes**: No

## Gateway Service Features

### 🚪 Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Reactive Routing**: Non-blocking request routing to microservices
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based request throttling
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience4j integration for fault tolerance
- **Security**: Spring Security with basic authentication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health endpoints

### 🏥 Health Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: All services have `/health` and `/ready` endpoints
- **Docker Healthchecks**: Proper service dependencies and startup order
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic service registration and discovery
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in load balancing capabilities

### 📊 Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards
- **Redis**: Rate limiting and caching
- **PostgreSQL**: Data persistence

## Service Architecture

### Gateway Routes
```yaml
/api/tasks/*     -> Task Service (8081)
/api/nlp/*       -> NLP Engine (3001)
/api/speech/*    -> Speech Service (8083)
/actuator/*      -> Gateway Management
```

### Health Endpoints
| Service | Health | Ready |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Gateway | `/actuator/health` | `/actuator/health/readiness` |
| Task Service | `/actuator/health` | `/actuator/health/readiness` |
| NLP Engine | `/api/health` | `/api/ready` |
| Speech Service | `/health` | `/ready` |

## Testing Infrastructure

### Gateway Testing
```bash
# Health and routing tests
./scripts/test-gateway.sh

# Stability tests
./scripts/stability-test.sh

# E2E smoke tests
make e2e-smoke
```

### Docker Compose
```bash
# Start all services with healthchecks
cd docker && docker-compose up -d

# Monitor service health
docker-compose ps
```

## Additional Components
